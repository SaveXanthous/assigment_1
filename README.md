* A Project Overview
    * The purpose of classes and programs is to meet the assignment 1 requirement
  * My whole life has been striving for something. It's just a stepping stone. This step touches too deeply on the past, since java was studied when I wasn't even in high school. I completed the assignment with my experience
* B Descriptions
  * The class fields, constructor, and methods of Student, Course class are all described in assignment 1.
  * The Course class is related to the Student class
* C Instructions to Compile and Run
  * javac *.java
  * java Main
* D Screenshots

* E Reflection Section
  * I may have learned something, but I can't find out what it is.
  * I didn't have any difficulties.
  * To be honest, I don't understand the advantages of OOP myself.
    When I change the programming language, I change the style and design, but there are the same models. It feels like it's OOP everywhere, but it's not. It's just that sometimes my coding style matches or approaches it.
